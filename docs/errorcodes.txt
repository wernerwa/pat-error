patError Error Codes
====================

Read readme.txt for documentation!

The list of error-codes is obsolete! Use id strings instead of integer
values.  We recommend to use id-strings in the following format: 

	(<PREFIX>:)<SUFFIX>

Where <PREFIX> is a string associated to source of the error, e.g. the name
of your application or class. <SUFFIX> is a numeric value used inside your
application to sepperate your errors within your application.

Of course you can use as many prefixes as you want - for example to handle
errors from different parts or modules of your application or package.
